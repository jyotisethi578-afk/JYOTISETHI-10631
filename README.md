C MINI PROJECT 
# Number Classification System (C Mini Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is developed using the C programming language.  
The Number Classification System takes a single integer as input and classifies it based on:
- Whether the number is **Positive, Negative, or Zero**
- Whether the number is **Even or Odd**
- Whether the number is a **Prime number or Not**

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly mini project for first-year students to understand conditional statements and loops in C.

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Project
To develop a system that analyzes a given number and provides its classification using simple logic and control structures in C.

---

## ❓ Why This Project Is Created
This project is created to:
- Strengthen understanding of **if statements**
- Learn the use of **modulo operator (%)**
- Implement **loop-based logic**
- Understand **prime number checking**
- Build logical thinking in C programming

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **C**
- Compiler: GCC / Turbo C / VS Code (any C compiler)

---

## 🧠 Logic Used
1. Input is taken using `scanf()`
2. Separate `if` statements check:
   - Positive / Negative / Zero
3. `%` operator checks:
   - Even or Odd
4. `for` loop checks:
   - Prime or Not Prime
5. Output is displayed using `printf()`

---

## 🛠️ Utility of the Project
- Useful for beginners learning C
- Helps in number analysis
- Can be used in:
  - Educational tools
  - Practice programs
  - Logic-building exercises

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
This project can be extended by:
- Making it **menu-driven**
- Accepting **multiple numbers**
- Adding checks for:
  - Palindrome number
  - Armstrong number
  - Perfect number
- Creating a **GUI version**
- Converting it into a **calculator-style application**
